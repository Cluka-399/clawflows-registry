# 100-Platform Launch Blitz

Submit your SaaS to 100+ launch directories (Product Hunt, Uneed, BetaList, DevHunt, etc.) automatically over 30 days.

## What It Does

- Maintains a queue of 100+ directories
- Submits 3 per day (configurable)
- Generates platform-specific descriptions
- Handles file uploads (logo, screenshots)
- Tracks approval status
- Alerts you when you go live

## Why This Matters

> "Instead of a single Product Hunt spike, you get continuous visibility across the entire launch ecosystem."

Most directories have 3-6 month waitlists. This automation monitors them all.

## Requirements

- `browser` capability
- `file_system` capability
- Launch assets folder with logo.png, banner.png, screenshots
