Write once, publish everywhere. Each version platform-native, not copy-paste garbage.

## What It Does

One blog post becomes:
- Medium article (reformatted for their editor)
- Dev.to post (with tags and series)
- Hashnode article (with canonical URL)
- LinkedIn article (professional angle)
- Twitter thread (key points extracted)
- Reddit posts to 5 subreddits (different angles each)

Then monitors engagement on each platform.

> "Each version is platform-native. Not copy-paste garbage. Actually optimized for how each platform works."

## Requirements

- `browser` capability (for publishing)
- Platform accounts configured
