# Hacker News Timing Bot

Post to HN at the right moment. Timing matters more than you think.

## What It Does

- Monitors HN activity patterns for your topic
- Detects optimal conditions (active users, low competition)
- Tests your titles for clickbait (HN hates it)
- Alerts you when it's go-time

> "When it detects optimal conditions (active relevant users, low competition, favorable moderation), it alerts you."

## Requirements

- `web_fetch`, `messaging` capabilities
- Pre-written HN-style titles
