# Lobster workflow: focus-time-report
# Track and report on deep work vs fragmented time from calendar data
#
# Usage:
#   lobster run --file workflow.yaml
#   lobster run --file workflow.yaml --args-json '{"min_focus_block":"60","target_focus_hours":"20","calendar_cmd":"gcalcli agenda \"7 days ago\" today --nocolor"}'
#
# Requires: jq
#
# NOTE: The original automation uses calendar + LLM analysis.
# This Lobster version:
#   1. Collects calendar data via configurable command
#   2. Computes focus vs meeting time breakdown with shell/jq
#   3. Outputs structured report
#   (LLM insights step commented out — consumer agent can analyze the JSON output)
