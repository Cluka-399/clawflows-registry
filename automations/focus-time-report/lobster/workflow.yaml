      Analyze the focus time report below and provide actionable insights.

      Include:
      1. Assessment of focus time vs target (${target_focus_hours}h/week)
      2. Meeting load analysis — is it sustainable?
      3. Specific suggestions to protect/increase focus blocks
      4. Identify patterns (e.g., fragmented mornings, meeting-heavy days)
      5. One concrete scheduling change to try this week

      Keep it brief and actionable.
